# The Foundry Way

## Contributing

To save duplication, please see `docs/index.md` of [go to the Foundry Way site](https://foundry.digital.mod.uk/) to see more about who can contribute and how (the publishing process). This is about how to contribute from a technical perspective. 

Since this repo uses MKDocs, there's a bit of setup required:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed
2. Set up a virtual environment, using `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Install the requirements for this repo, using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once this is done, you can then run the MKDocs site locally, by running `mkdocs serve`.
