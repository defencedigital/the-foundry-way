# Managing secrets

'Secrets' can be a number of things, including passwords, keys, credentials, certificates, etc.

## Storing secrets

Under no circumstances should secrets ever be stored in or committed to code version control. Instead, you should use a secrets-management tool, such as GitHub Secrets.

TODO: more specific guidance on which tools to use when.
