# Foundry projects and teams

Projects and teams who engage with the Foundry can do so in a few ways:

- Be "facilitated" by the Foundry
- Be "incubated" by the Foundry
- Be "supported" by the Foundry

Each of these options involves a different level of support from the Foundry, and a different level of commitment from the project or team. 

## Facilitated teams and projects

"Facilitated" teams are at the beginning of their journey. They think they're onto something: that there's a user need that needs to be met and that they might have a good idea as to how they might meet that need. 

These teams, however, need a bit of a leg up or springboard – they need one or more of the following:

- Support running a [Discovery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works) 
- A place to prototype and test ideas (a sandbox hosting area)
- The equipment and tooling to work effectively as a digital team: things like code version control, collaborative tools, etc.

Teams should expect to get up to (and not beyond) the point of delivering an [Alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) phase, while being facilitated, before moving onto being "incubated" or otherwise.
