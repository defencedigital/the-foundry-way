# Data in Digital Foundry

<!-- Add Introduction here-->

## What does The Data Strategy for Defence mean for Defence Digital Foundry?

The [Data Strategy for Defence](www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-strategy-for-defence) sets out the context and problem that currently faces the MoD in the data area. It describes the response in terms of setting up the Office of the CDO, and goes on to break out six key principles that will drive MoD Data Rules;

### Defence data Rules

- **Sovereign** Defence data will be owned and managed by Defence for access and use by the whole of Defence
- **Standardised** Data will be in standardised (open?) formats
- **Exploitable** Data will be available for exploitation at the most appropriate point
- **Secure and Digital by Design** Creation, curation, handling, storage and transmission of data will be secure and digital from the outset
- **Curated** Data will be assured, discoverable, and interoperable by active curation
- **Enduring** Data will be treated as an asset above and beyond the generating entity

### Where does Foundry operate in the Defence Data Framework?

The Data Strategy defines a framework approach to describing the ways and means available to achieve the desired transformation. The Digital Foundry has been established to work within the Enabler and Facilitator spaces to consume the data rules, and help deliver the technology solutions that will meet the strategic vision.

1. Enablers

2. Facilitators

### What are the key outcomes?

- Discover-ability

- Accessibility

- Exploitability

Foundry solutions will focus on increasing the ability to discover and understand what data is already held. It will put in place srvices which allow data to be published by data publishers as managed products, whiclts increasing the control and governance of those uses. Foundry will deliver platforms and processes to enable data to be surfaced and made accessible, and then exploited in modern and innovative ways. This includes providing services into DAIC to

### How does Foundry work with DD CDO function?

The Defence Digital CDO function has identified 3 core pillars, and appointed leads in each of these areas:
1. Governance and Management
2. Data Architecture
3. Data Exploitation

Foundry is intended to be the delivery engine which implements solutions to support and enable those pillars.

#### Governance and Management

##### Authorisation

Foundry Teams will need to work with Data owners to ensure they have the right permissions in place to use and exploit Data. The CDO team will support teams in establishing Ownership and Stewardship processes.

##### Data Owner Identification

#### Catalogues

#### Architecture

##### Design Governance

#### Exploitation
