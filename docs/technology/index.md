# Technology

The Technology section is guidance on the preferred tools and services the
Defence Digital Foundry offers and recommends using.

The technology areas are grouped in the following categories

* **Tools:** Software used in the delivery or operation of software systems
(e.g. code editors, issue trackers, code linters) or standalone components of
running systems (e.g. databases, message queues).
* **Techniques:** A way of doing things (e.g. pair programming, Kanban, short lived feature branches, impact mapping).
* **Platforms:** Environments within which our software runs (e.g. Linux,
  Containers, Apple/Android, Google Workspaces, Kubernetes, AWS).
* **People:** Roles, Reliability Engineering, Service Levels etc.
* **Frameworks:** Programming languages and frameworks (e.g. Go, Python, Flask).

The Digital Foundry recognises there are many ways to achieve an outcome in
the digital and technology area. By default we would expect digital services
teams to use the tools in our 'Approved' category. We will have a 'Consider'
category over time of things that may be acceptable by exception and 'Avoid'
where we expect you to not use.
