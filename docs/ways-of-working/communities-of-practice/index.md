# Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Communities of Practice (CoP)

Communities of practice are for people who share common job roles, responsibilities or remits. They do well through regular interaction and common goals.

The Foundry encourages the use of communities of practice, as they are a productive environment for the cross-pollination of ideas and experiences, building networks, understanding processes outside your immediate work, connecting with fellow professionals, and sharing your professionâ€™s challenges or concerns.

## Foundry-supported Communities of Practice

Currently, the Foundry hosts the following communities of practice:

- User-centred design
- Product and delivery management
- DevOps
