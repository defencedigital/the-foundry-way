## Artefacts and meetings

The following table aims to answer '*how do I find out [x]*' based on your potential role with relation to the product team. Unfortunately, we will not be able to facilitate anything that falls outside of this table.

## Common expectations vs. how we work

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of areas in which expectations may not match the way we work. Unfortunately, we will not be able to facilitate anything in the right-hand column if it conflicts with our ways of working. 

| Desired outcome | How we achieve this | Possible alternative expectation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Introduce something (e.g. a feature) to the product/service | :material-check-circle: Present a hypothesis to the product team to validate and solve | :material-close-circle: Provide requirements or formed feature designs for the product team to deliver |
