# How we work when we're delivering with/for others

In the Foundry, we know that different people and teams work in (sometimes very) different ways. This section, therefore, is here to explain how we work, which helps our stakeholders and partners to make an informed decision about how/if they work with us to deliver solutions to their problems. 

There are two main areas that we know tend to be the biggest areas of contrast. These are as follows.

## 1. Communications between the Foundry and 'the business'

### Communicating with the product delivery team

As a rule, teams and individuals from 'the business' should expect **not to have any direct contact** with the delivery team, particularly when it comes to:

- Requesting features / setting priorities
- Requesting / requiring reporting and metrics (more below)

These things are clearly important, so we follow the Government-set approach to doing so, which involves having a Service Owner from 'the business'. We have created [guidance for Service Owners](service-owners-in-the-business.md) (or those coordinating work with the Foundry who might appoint a Service Owner), which describes our expectations as to what they do and how interactions with the product team(s) work. 

#### Reporting

It is common for projects and programmes to expect a variety of different reports in a variety of different formats. Since we do not provide such reporting in what much of Defence considers to be 'normal', we have set out [how we report in the Foundry](../reporting.md), keeping stakeholders abreast of a number of forms of progress and measurement. 

### Communicating with Foundry management

For more information about how the Foundry is structured, have a look at our [who are we](../../the-foundry/who-we-are.md) section. However, here are some of the common things that customers want to talk about, and with whom they should talk about each of those things:

| Thing | Foundry area | Contact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finance | The Foundry's Engine Room |  |
| Commercial | The Foundry's Engine Room |  |
| Product delivery (and delivery teams) | Defence Digital Service |  |
| Delivery methodologies and approaches | Digital Communities |  |
| Information about platforms and other technology questions | Foundry Platforms |  |

### Communicating with Foundry suppliers

This heading is here for completeness, but there is no expectation that any stakeholders would have any direct contact with any of our suppliers. As far as our customers are concerned, all of our teams should be considered as The Foundry, even if they are provided by suppliers. 

If there are concerns with performance, then this should be raised as it would in any other circumstance: getting in touch with the appropriate line management (or supplier management) chain, as above.

## 2. The empowerment of product teams and how they deliver

In Defence, it is common to expect that IT projects will follow a typical waterfall process, whereby you have an idea, have somebody do some analysis, write some requirements, hand those requirements to a supplier, and then have some sort of acceptance testing and process at the end. 

This is not how we work. Instead, we follow [agile ways of working](https://agilemanifesto.org/), following the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), and through [product teams, rather than feature teams](https://www.svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/). Since the collision of these two ways of working can be problematic, we've written this page to explain [what you can expect from a product team](product-team-expectations.md). 

If you're curious to know more about how we work, feel free to have a look at [our product delivery guidance](../../product-and-service-delivery/index.md), as it grows, and information about our more general [ways of working](../index.md).
