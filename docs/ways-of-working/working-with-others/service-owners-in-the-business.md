# Service Owners who come from 'the business'

It will sometimes be the case that a Foundry product team is working in a problem space that is 'owned' by another part of Defence. This is particularly likely (in fact, will be the case for the majority of the time) in the [Defence Digital Service (DDS)](../../the-foundry/who-we-are.md) part of the Foundry.

In this case, we will almost always require the [Service Owner](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/service-owner) to be from the appropriate part of 'the business'. We will *always* require that there is **one single** Service Owner.

## The role of the Service Owner

The general role of a Service Owner is articulated in the [DDaT Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/service-owner). This is the only definition of a Service Owner that we recognise. 

The Service Owner must therefore:

- be the single point of priority-setting from 'the business'
- be the single point of escalation from 'the business'
- carry out the responsibilities laid out in the Framework, as linked above

For the avoidance of doubt, it is therefore unacceptable for this role to be shared between two or more individuals. 

## Known challenges with ways of working

An example of where this may conflict with other organisations' ways of working is as follows:

*Alice is known as the 'product owner' for a service and she is the subject matter expert in the service's area of operation. Bob is the Programme Director for the funding programme and has/sets other priorities and requires certain reporting. Each of Alice and Bob would like to provide different direction to the Foundry's product delivery team.*

In this case, it will be the responsibility of the Service Owner to present a unified, finalised point of view to the product team. The product team will not interface with several parts of 'the business' (e.g. between Alice and Bob) to elicit a consensus. This ensures that they can focus on delivery, without the fear of having regular or short-notice changes required by them.
