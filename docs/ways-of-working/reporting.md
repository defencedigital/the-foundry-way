# Reporting in the Foundry

In the Foundry, we have a principle:

> Teams shouldn't have to produce or maintain anything that is not useful to them

However, that doesn't mean they don't have to maintain any documentation at all! Instead, we try to ensure that the only things that we do require our teams to maintain are useful to them, first and foremost, even if they have the secondary purpose of allowing the Foundry's senior leadership (and other reporting mechanisms in Defence) to get the information it needs.

We, in essence, try to do things in a way that follows the [Governance principles for agile service delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/governance-principles-for-agile-service-delivery) laid out in the GOV.UK Service Manual. 

To that end, we ask our teams to do/create/maintain the following:

| The outcome | The thing we ask teams to do | Who in the team is responsible | How often it should be done or maintained |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Articulate what your product or service does and for whom | Create an maintain a [product canvas](../people-skills-and-standards/product-management/artefacts/product-canvas.md) | Product manager or service owner | Once, although you may edit it as you find out more |
| Articulate the value that your product or service will provide, allow for dependencies to be identified, etc. | Maintain a [roadmap](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/developing-a-roadmap) | Product manager | Reviewed at least quarterly |
| Describe the high-level outcomes you're working on over time | Create [objectives and key results (OKRs)](../people-skills-and-standards/product-management/artefacts/OKRs.md) | Product manager (often with service owner) | Usually quarterly or more frequently |
| Monitor areas of delivery that may need help succeeding | Monitor your team's confidence in achieving your KRs | Product and delivery manager | In-line with your sprint cadence or at least monthly |
| Monitor the performance of your product or service | Establish and monitor product or service health metrics. This might include [Service Level Objectives (SLOs)](../running-services/reliability-engineering/service-levels.md) | Product and delivery manager | In-line with your sprint cadence or at least monthly |
| Monitor the health and morale of your team | Establish and monitor [team health](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/09/squad-health-check-model/) metrics. Run regular [retrospectives](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques#:~:text=in%20sprint%20reviews-,Retrospective%20meetings,-Retrospectives%2C%20sometimes%20called) | Delivery manager | In-line with your sprint cadence or at least monthly |
| Reflect on recent work and articulate immediate next steps | Run regular, open [show and tell](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques#:~:text=creators%20of%20Scrum-,Team%20review%20(show%20and%20tell),-The%20team%20review) sessions | Product and delivery manager | In-line with your sprint cadence |
