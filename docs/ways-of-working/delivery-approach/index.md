#Delivery Approach 

!!! info

    Defence Digital Foundry follows the GDS Agile Delivery approach, which can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery).


# Discovery 

Before you commit to building a service, you need to understand the problem that needs to be solved.

That means learning about:

* your users and what they’re trying to achieve
* any constraints you’d face making changes to how the service is run - for example because of technology or legislation
* the underlying policy intent you’ve been set up to address - this is the thing that government wants to change or make happen
* opportunities to improve things - by sharing data with other teams, for example
* This part of your project is called the discovery phase.

What you learn during discovery should help you work out whether you want to move forward to the alpha phase. Running an alpha means you’ve decided that the benefits of looking further into the problem outweigh the cost.

You should not start building your service in discovery.

# Alpha

Alpha is where you try out different solutions to the problems you learnt about during discovery.

Spend alpha building prototypes and testing different ideas. And do not be afraid to challenge the way things are done at the moment: alpha is a chance to explore new approaches.

You do not have to prototype the user’s entire wider journey.

You might not even want to prototype all of the transaction or element you’re working on: often it makes sense just to focus on the areas you think will be most challenging. This lets you do the minimum you need to test your riskiest assumptions.

Alpha services should not be available for the public to use.

With any online solutions you try out, build things that are just complex enough to let you test different ideas, not production quality code. Expect to throw away any code - and lots of the ideas you test - at the end of alpha.

By the end of alpha, you should be in a position to decide which of the ideas you’ve tested are worth taking forward to beta.

Alphas tend to last between 6 and 8 weeks. Which means you should book your alpha assessment within a fortnight of starting your alpha.

It’s useful to think about who you’ll need in your team at alpha.

# Beta

The beta phase is where you take your best idea from alpha and start building it for real. It also involves thinking about how your service will integrate with (or start to replace) existing services, and preparing for the transition to live.

Structure your beta phase so you can roll out the service to real users - while minimising risk and maximising the potential to learn and iterate the service. Make sure:

the service team has the capacity to sustain that learning and iteration throughout the beta period
support staff are able to cope with new users who might struggle to use the service in ways you have not foreseen
You’ll start out in ‘private beta’. This involves inviting a limited number of people to use your service so you can get feedback and improve it.

Once you’ve improved the service and are confident you can run it at scale, you take an assessment to move into ‘public beta’. This involves opening up your service to anyone who needs it. If you’re replacing a legacy service, keep the legacy service running until your new service moves into its live phase.

You should book your assessment 6 weeks before you want to be assessed.


# Live

The live phase is about supporting the service in a sustainable way, and continuing to iterate and make improvements. You’ll also:

* continue to address any constraints you identified at beta
* continue to develop the service and work with other organisations providing services that are part of the same journey, so *  that you’re iterating towards solving a whole problem for users
* transition or integrate any existing transactions that meet a similar need to yours - making sure that what you end up with has a scope that makes sense to users
* You’ll have your live assessment at the end of the public beta phase. Spend public beta preparing for live.
