# Product management in the Foundry

This section is aimed at describing how we do product management in the Foundry. 

Clearly, much of the way we do product management is the same as everywhere in the world, so this isn't aiming to teach PMs how to do their job in general, but rather its aim is to:

- Point out any peculiarities to how Defence works that affects your work
- Describe the sorts of [artefacts](./artefacts/index.md) that the Foundry expects our PMs to own, create, maintain, etc.

## Product management vs. product ownership

This phenomenon deserves a section of its own, so it got one. 

Across Defence, you'll often find people with the title/role of 'product owner' and this can easily be a cause for confusion. In almost all of these situations, the individual is more likely to be more akin to a [Service Owner](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/service-owner), in that they're not experienced as a 'product person' but tend to be from 'the business' where the problem space sits, and are usually able to make higher-level priority decisions. 

In the Foundry, as is the case across most of UK Government, 'product manager' and 'product owner' are titles that are used interchangeably. 

Let's not get into a discussion as to whether or not they are in fact the same thing. [There are articles](https://www.svpg.com/product-manager-vs-product-owner-revisited/) that describe possible differentiations, and it's well known that Product Owner is a specific [role in the Scrum framework](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner).

For the avoidance of doubt, it means you do the job that is [outlined in the digital, data and technology (DDaT) capability framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager).
