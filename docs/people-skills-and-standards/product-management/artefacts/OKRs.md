# Objectives and key results (OKRs) 

Objectives and key results - or OKRs (note the lack of an apostrophe, you grammar heathens) - are part of a collaborative, goal-setting methodology used by teams and individuals to set challenging, ambitious goals with measurable results. They are how you track progress, create alignment, and encourage engagement around measurable goals.

!!! warning "They are also very hard to do well!"

As with the rest of the Foundry Way, this section isn't about teaching you in-depth about OKRs; if you're interested in knowing more, have a look at the OKR bible - a.k.a. [Radical Focus, by Christina Wodtke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28951428-radical-focus). Instead, this is intended to describe and link out to how we use OKRs (e.g. for reporting), as well as giving some lightweight guidance for generating and managing them. 

## OKRs as a reporting mechanism

More on reporting can be found in the [ways of working](../../../ways-of-working/index.md) section of the Foundry Way.

Broadly speaking, your team's confidence in their ability to meet the KRs (and therefore, by definition, the Objectives) will be used by Foundry management to do a couple of things: 

1. Identify areas where teams may need additional support to increase the likelihood of KRs being achieved
2. Lightweight reporting 'upwards', which shows what we're hoping to achieve in a given timescale. In essence, the Objectives replace what traditional reporting would have considered to be 'milestones'

## How to generate OKRs

Generally speaking, OKRs are the business of a product manager (hence this guidance sitting in this section of the Foundry Way), but in reality it's a team sport. 

### Step 1: initial setting of OKRs

This step can be done with your team, or at a higher level (often with the Service Owner). Since the actual KRs should be based on your team’s confidence (see the [tracking OKRs](#tracking-okrs) section), you (or anybody higher in the programme/organisation, including the Service Owner) should not set these without them.

How you do this is ultimately up to you, but the following template is designed to help you to sense-check what you're considering. It essentially forces you to consider the value, viability and measurability of the thing.

### Step 2: finalising OKRs

This must be done with your team. You should not commit to OKRs before now. 

Once OKRs (objectives, in particular) have been set, you should work with your team to finalise them. This includes checking any assumptions you made previously, and setting final metrics. Your team’s confidence in their ability to achieve an objective should be about 7-8 out of 10 to start with. This ensures that it’s ambitious but achievable. 

You should then end up with something like…

> Objective: Create an Awesome Customer Experience
> 
> Key results:
> 
> - Improve Net Promoter Score from 8 to 9
> - Increase repurchase rate by 13%
> - Increase organic (non-paid-for) traffic by 20%

Or a Foundry-specific example might be something like this:

> Objective: Tech for Digital Teams (T4DT) users can work and collaborate easily
> 
> Key results:
> 
> - Developers can get access to basic tooling within 1 working day
> - Users can get a Foundry email account within 1 working day
> - 100% of Foundry staff have moved to assured virtual whiteboard software by the end of the quarter

## Tracking OKRs

OKRs are only useful if they’re part of your daily ways of working. This template (taken from Radical Focus) helps you do so, and to track other important team things.

Note: only the top-right corner of the grid is OKR-specific; the remainder of the grid is for tracking other useful elements. 

Specifically, the top-left is for tracking weekly priorities, the bottom-left is for tracking notable things that are happening in the team's orbit that will affect your work, and the bottom-right is for tracking your team's health (mandatory in the Foundry) and any other metrics that you know you need to keep an eye on, probably including [service level objectives (SLOs)](../../../running-services/reliability-engineering/service-levels.md).

It's recommended that you do this as regularly as practical, but the expectation in the Foundry is that you'll do so at least monthly.

## Advice and 'gotchas'

The following are things to watch out for when setting OKRs (especially the KR bit):

- Key results that have a boolean measurement (i.e. are either true or false) should be severely in the minority – numbers, percentages, etc. are better
- OKRs present a goal for a team to attain; how they do it is their business. As such, make sure you don’t force a particular solution in their articulation
- Beware of KRs that are dependent on other people, teams, or work that’s completely outside of your control. e.g. “this team has adopted our thing” or "this team has done [this thing]"
