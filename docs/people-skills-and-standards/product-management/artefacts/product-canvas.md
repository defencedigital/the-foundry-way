# Product canvas

A product canvas, as you probably know, is a way of recording and communicating the purpose of the product that you are responsible for. Roman Pichler has a [great template](https://www.romanpichler.com/tools/the-product-canvas/) for most occasions, but this section aims to specify what we need our product people to include.

## Template

The following is the info we need your canvas to cover. If you keep it in this format, it's easy to drop it into our current roadmap.

Depending on which phase of delivery your product is currently in, you may not have some of this information, or it may change readily. That's fine, of course.

### Vision statement

Short vision statement that is aspirational and value-driven

_e.g. Revolutionise people's lives with the greatest experience of augmented reality zoo visiting in the world_

### Description

A bit more of a description of the problem space. 

### User needs / value proposition

Best articulated in the normal 'user story' format, describe the highest level needs of your users (by user group). Probably in bullet format. 

_e.g. - As an animal fanatic who does not live near animals, I need somehow to see all of my favourite animals from my home, so that I can fulfil my animal-related dreams_

### Measures of success

Describe the high-level indicators of success for your product. These can be qualitative or quantitative, but must be measurable. 

_e.g. - Percentage of the world's zoo-goers who use the service_

_e.g. - Number of users who describe their experience as life-changing_
