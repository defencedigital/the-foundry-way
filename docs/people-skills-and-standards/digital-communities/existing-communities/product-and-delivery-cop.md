# Product and delivery management CoP

**Who can join:** Any military, civilian, contractor or consultant working as a [Product Owner/Manager](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-manager), [Delivery Manager](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/delivery-manager) or [Service Owner](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/service-owner), as part of their role in the UK Ministry of Defence. We welcome any of these roles from any MoD organisation (any TLB, ALB, etc.). 

If youâ€™re not sure if you match any of those roles, either come along anyway, or have a look at the [Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework) for more information. 

**When:** fortnightly on a Thursday, from 14:00-15:00 (subject to change)

**Where:** you can join the Microsoft Teams meeting without being invited (come along!), or email [iain@digital.mod.uk](mailto:iain@digital.mod.uk) for an invitation to join.

Outside of those regular meet-ups, you can also find us on the [CoP's Slack channel](https://defencedigital.slack.com/archives/C01AS6JCAUW).

**What is discussed:** Anything that relates to product, delivery or service management. Our current members have said that the community is useful for:

- getting help from the group with a problem that somebody is facing
- discuss techniques and approaches
- find and discuss learning and development opportunities
- find shadowing and other similar opportunities
- for people joining one of these roles, understand a bit more about the discipline and how to develop

This community operates under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule), creating a safe-space for practitioners to share challenges of their work.

Please note, all of these calls take place at the OFFICIAL classification.
