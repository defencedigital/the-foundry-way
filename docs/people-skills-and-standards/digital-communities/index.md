# Digital communities

Communities of practice are for people who share common job roles, responsibilities or remits. They do well through regular interaction and common goals.

The Foundry encourages the use of communities of practice, as they are a productive environment for the cross-pollination of ideas and experiences, building networks, understanding processes outside your immediate work, connecting with fellow professionals, and sharing your professionâ€™s challenges or concerns.

## Foundry-run communities

The Foundry is responsible for running the communities that sit broadly within the 'digital' part of the [Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), hence the name 'Digital Communities'. 

We have split the job families and disciplines into the following logical groupings, with appropriate 'Heads of' associated:

| DDaT job family | Disciplines in the community | Head of community | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product and delivery | Product manager, Service owner, Business analyst | Head of Product, Iain Baars-Gordon, [iain@digital.mod.uk](mailto:iain@digital.mod.uk) |
| Product and delivery | Delivery manager, Programme delivery manager | Head of Delivery (person TBC) |
| Technical | Frontend developer, Software developer, Test Engineer, Quality Assurance Testing Analyst | Principle Developer (person TBC) |
| User-centred design | User researcher | Head of User Research, Silvia Grant, [silvia@digital.mod.uk](mailto:silvia@digital.mod.uk) |
| User-centred design | Content designer, Content strategist, Technical writer | Head of Content Design, John Szymanski, [john.szymanski@digital.mod.uk](mailto:john.szymanski@digital.mod.uk) |
| User-centred design | Service designer, Graphic designer, Interaction designer | Head of Service Design (person TBC) |

## Communities run by others

The data- and technology-focussed communities are run by other groups in Defence. 

We'll provide links to those people and places as they're made available.
