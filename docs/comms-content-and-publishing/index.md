# Communications, content management and publishing

The Foundry will produce itself, and facilitate the production by or with others, a lot of content for many different audiences and purposes. This guidance describes who should manage what kind of content, where it should be published, how, and with what style. 

Below is a summary of our approach, but more detail is and will be available for each content type.

## Content publishing summary: who, what and where?

| Content type | Where it's published | Who writes or curates it | Who has editorial oversight | Tone of voice (ToV) and style to use |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Project or programme information (e.g. ‘about your team’) | Wherever works best for the team. Probably somewhere like Google, SharePoint, Confluence. | The team | The team (possibly someone like a Service Owner or Product Manager) | Not applicable |
| Training | Defence Learning Environment (DLE), unless good reason (link on DLE to COTS training) | The team (content and UX designers) | Team Product Owner for general content; Foundry comms for adherence to ToV, etc. | Foundry ToV and style guide, unless using off-the shelf training |
| Product or service landing page (sort of marketing) | TBC (expectation that in the future all services are on a .service.mod.uk subdomain) | The team (content and UX designers) | Team Product Owner for general content; Foundry comms for adherence to ToV, etc. | Foundry ToV and style guide |
| How to interact with a product or service (e.g. developer or API documentation) | Either on GitHub (e.g. GitHub Pages) or on a docs.[yourservice].mod.uk site, using a pattern | The team (content and UX designers) | Team Product Owner for general content; Foundry comms for adherence to ToV, etc. | Foundry ToV and style guide |
| Guidance about how a thing is done in Defence (e.g. ‘how we recruit users for user research’ or ‘how we do DevOps’) | The Defence Service Manual (standards.digital.mod.uk) | Anyone in the relevant community of practice | Head of Discipline (accuracy), policy lead (compliance), Standards team content designers | Standards as a Service style guide (basically GOV.UK style guide with additions) |
| ‘How we do things in the Foundry’ (manage our local tech, run communities of practice, etc.) | The Foundry Way (this document - meta, right? - foundry.digital.mod.uk) | The relevant person or group in the Foundry | The Foundry Way Forum | Foundry ToV and style guide |
