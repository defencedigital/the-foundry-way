# The Foundry Way to Service Management

Foundry will address service management by embodying principles set out in ITIL and within corporate service management directives.  We will use these as a guide to how services are provisioned and the way they are managed.

ITIL lists 7 principles that are enduring and can be applied universally.  Foundry will look to adopt and align to these principles when considering service management.

Service Management principles:

1. Focus on Value
2. Start Where you Are
3. Progress interactively with feedback
4. Collaborate and  promote visibly
5. Think and work holistically
6. Keep it simple and practical
7. Optimise and automate

## 1. Focus on Value

Everything the Digital Foundry does needs to deliver value to Defence.  Therefore it is essential that the needs of Defence Stakeholders, e.g. Front Line Commands, Top Level Budgets area, etc. are clearly understood and who the services that are delivered through the Foundry affect.

Over time, circumstances vary, services develop and priorities change, so it is important that the true value of the services delivered need to be assessed continually.

Additionally, customer experience, whether subjective or objective, needs to be understood to offer best service.

## 2. Start Where you Are

The Foundry is not looking to build a new service management model but will consider reuse of existing services management that fulfil its needs and meet corporate directives.

This principle considers the current state to establish a clear view, using available data and measurements, on what can be reused or what will need to be established to meet the Foundry’s service management demands.

## 3. Progress interactively with feedback.
‘Feedback is the breakfast for champions’ - Keith Blanchard
This principle focuses on iterative delivery rather than doing everything at once allowing for work to be broken down into smaller manageable chunks.  Ensuring there is a feedback loop so work can be evaluated, re-evaluated and altered if necessary to continually deliver value.

## 4. Collaborate and promote visibility
To enable positive collaboration, trust needs to be established.  Foundry will seek to share information (where possible) and be transparent in their activities.  We will keep track of work in progress, identify bottlenecks and waste and seek opportunities to work with our partners and stakeholders.
Foundry will make sure that people have the right roles and responsibilities.  
Communication either directly through collaboration or indirectly through other sources will be checked for correctness and set at the right level appropriate for the receiving audience

## 5. Think and work holistically
All activities within the Digital Foundry will have the same value delivery focus.  They will be connected through the Foundry Way by clear communication between service owners and a view of the bigger Defence picture.

## 6. Keep it simple and practical
Don’t make things too complicated! However, some things are complex or have intertwined complexity.  Where this does happen, exceptions need to be defined and ‘rule of engagement’ put in place. A part of the Foundry Way, should aim to keep things simple, do less things better.  Ask the question ‘Does this service or process add value?’

## 7. Optimise and Automate
Foundry will look to make the most from the work performed by people and technical resources.  Foundry will look to automate where there are frequent and repetitive tasks being performed, thereby releasing people to focus on more complex tasks that deliver or help to deliver value to Defence.

Foundry will need to ensure that we do not automate for automation’s sake and that where we are looking to automate the value and benefits to Defence business is clear.
