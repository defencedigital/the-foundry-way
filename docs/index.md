# The Foundry Way

Welcome to The Foundry Way! This is a place for the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) [Digital Foundry](https://defencedigital.blog.gov.uk/2021/07/15/hello-world-from-the-digital-foundry/) to be transparent about how we work. Within the Foundry, it helps our people (new and existing) to work in a consistent and agreed (but not necessarily uniform) way. 

It's important to note that the Foundry Way is subordinate to a number of other things. These include (but aren't limited to):

- The [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)
- The [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
- The [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice)
- The Defence Service Manual (in Alpha)

## Contributing to the Foundry Way

The source code (and therefore content) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/defencedigital/the-foundry-way). 

### Who can do what

First things first, anybody can either suggest changes or raise issues relating to the Foundry Way. However, this does not necessarily mean that those changes will be accepted or those issues acted upon. 

The overarching principle is that content relating to a thematic area (e.g. software development) is governed by the relevant community of practice. As such, changes to and acceptance of content will be coordinated by the head of that community of practice (e.g. the Principal Developer). See our communities pages for more info. 

Hopefully it won't come to this, but in the case where a consensus can't be reached, the head of discipline will case the deciding vote (or veto).

### How to contribute (the practicalities)

There are a few ways that you can contribute, based on either your technical propensities, thematic knowledge, etc. 

If you're happy with using git (and GitHub), feel free either to raise a pull request (PR) or an issue. All PRs have to go through review before being merged. 

If you're not and you're outside of the Ministry of Defence, then there's no way for you contribute for now (sorry about that).

If you're not but you're inside the Ministry of Defence, then you can do one of two things:

- Jump on Slack, on the #the-foundry-way channel, and make a suggestion, comment, etc.
- If you have access to Foundry tech, head to the Foundry Way shared drive and make suggestions, add documents, etc.
