# Our approach to product and service delivery

The Foundry follows the Government-wide approach to delivery and ways of working, outlined in detail in [the GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). This includes following the usual [phases of delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery), with a [proper multi-disciplinary team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team) of [DDaT professionals](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), etc. 

The Foundry Way has been created to explain how we implement these standards in a Foundry-specific context. The Defence Service Manual will, by contrast, describe how we meet those and other standards in a cross-Defence context.
