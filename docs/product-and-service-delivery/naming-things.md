# Naming things

How you name things is important, as it changes the way (and how easily) users interact with that thing. ‘Thing’, in this context, refers to teams/projects, products and services. You should always think about and research with your users when considering a name – do not just proceed based on your individual/team or senior stakeholder preference. 

If you host a product or service on a MoD subdomain*, you will have to adhere to this guidance. This may be surfaced as part of a service assessment, if you undertake one. 

\* These in particular include *.service.mod.uk and *.service.mod.gov.uk

## Who should name things?

A common theme below is that names should be user-centred; however, this doesn’t mean that you ask your users and go with their best ideas (that would usually be an anti-pattern). Instead, what it means is that user-centred design specialists in your team should be heavily involved in the generation of a name or names, followed by the name being ‘signed off’ by the Product Manager/Owner and/or Service Owner of the product or service. 

For clarity, here’s a list of people who should not name things. You may wish to run options past these people/groups if you have a few options that are testing equally well, but otherwise your naming should be based on users and their needs. So, names should not be set by:

- Higher-level bodies, such as programmes (even if they’re funding the product or service)
- Senior stakeholders or other people with general authority

## Naming teams and projects

Since team and project names are internal, it ultimately doesn’t matter what you call them. You’ll often name the project or team before you know what the end product/service is going to do, so it stands to reason that the team or project name might not reflect what the solution is named. However, it is worth considering the following:

- If you want people to engage with your project/team, it might be worth using a name that describes what the problem space the team/project is working in
- Since it is highly unlikely that the end product will be named the same as your project or team, it’s worth managing the expectations of stakeholders (especially senior ones) early on, so that you don’t feel too committed to the name when it comes to naming your product/service

## Naming a product, service, platform, etc.

### Transactional products/services

According to the GOV.UK Service Manual, good names for a service:

- use the words users use
- are based on analytics and user research
- describe a task, not a technology
- do not need to change when policy or technology changes
- are verbs, not nouns
- do not include government department or agency names
- are not brand-driven or focused on marketing

If your product or service is public-facing, it must follow those GOV.UK Service Manual guidelines. Nobody has the prerogative to deviate from this. 

However, not all products/services are transactional and, even when they are, they often require or allow users to do more than one main activity, which makes naming more difficult. Therefore, you should consider the following principles. 

### Complex transactional services

For products and services that have too many or too diverse a set of transactions to allow for a sensible verb-based name, then the above guidance may not make sense. In this case, you will certainly have to research several names with users, but you may wish to consider the following:

Is there a higher-level verb that broadly describes the thing? 
Can you use the final transaction in a series of things to describe the whole? 
For example, ‘Apply for a [something]’ might also include ‘Check if you’re eligible for a [something]’ and ‘Get help with a [something]’
Is there a well-known (within your user community) product that does a similar thing, whose name you can (legally and ethically) borrow or adapt?

### Non-transactional products, services, platforms, etc.

This type of ‘thing’ should continue to follow the GOV.UK Service Manual guidelines as closely as possible, but without contriving a name that sounds too odd or difficult to engage with. Again, this will almost certainly require considerable research with your users. 

> Remember, developers, administrators, etc. are users too – not just ‘end users’ such as those on the frontline or the public!

However, it is likely that non-transactional, complex, multifaceted products, platforms, services, etc. will not easily fit into patterns like ‘Do a thing’. Instead you should focus more on ‘using words that users use’. As such:

You may be able to find an analogous thing that your users already use, which could provide inspiration. For example, the ‘Defence Service Manual’ uses its users’ familiarity with the ‘GOV.UK Service Manual’ as the clear basis for its name
In the technical world, users may be very familiar with terminology that would otherwise be considered too much jargon. For example, the ‘GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS)’

## General guidance

If you are providing the thing on behalf of the whole of the MoD (i.e. it has been established that your thing is the main, central, only, etc. of its kind for the whole organisation), then you should begin the name with ‘Defence …’. 

> Examples: Defence Service Manual, Defence Data Analytics Platform

If you are producing the thing for use only by your team or department, then you may wish to begin the name with a similar prefix that identifies your organisation.

> Examples: The Foundry Way, The Army Hosting Environment, etc.
