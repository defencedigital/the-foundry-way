# Civilian-Military protocol in Agile User Research

The majority of professional user researchers are civilian contractors, consultants, or civil servants.


Dealing with military users implies different protocols, but utilises the same user research analytical skills. The main different in dealing with service personnel is around recruitment, rank acknowledgment and respect, and ways to address users both formally and informally.


- On the topic of addressing military users via written communication, best practice within the MOD is to **start communications using their abbreviated rank, followed by their first name** (i.e. Wg Cdr David).
- If there is a significant disparity between your role rank equivalent and the user’s higher rank, **you can also only refer to them by their title rank** (i.e. General)
- As a civilian **you are not required to Sir/Ma’am officers.**


In spoken conversation, and if in formal arrangements, please refer to military users using their rank, followed by their first name. The user can ask you to switch to first-name basis where appropriate.


It is **important to acknowledge the rank system** within the different domains. Please use [this table](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/28119/20101014145X_Pecking_Order_CompU.pdf) to familiarise yourself with the hierarchy.


Hierarchy is part of the military environment, and essential to its effective chain of command.


When it comes to securing the time of a military user, there is also a chain of command to follow. You must **get consent from their commanding officer to secure time spent on user research activities.** Even if it’s a line on an email, you will need this confirmation to use the time. You can user this confirmation as a pseudo-certificate, attaching it to formal UR requests. This is especially important if you run more than one session with the same user, or are trying to speak to multiple users from the same team. This applies to both remote and in-person research.


All Foundry projects will have a military sponsor. If you find you cannot identify the right person to secure user research activity time, you should ask your military sponsor to introduce you into the correct area of contact.

You must allow extra time for this recruitment activity, ideally having this in place in Sprint0 or pre-discovery.

When running research with military users start interactions with a relatively formal language, keeping colloquialisms initially to a minimum, as this is likely the way they will start interactions with you. This can be adjusted as confidence and familiarity of the relationship is built.
