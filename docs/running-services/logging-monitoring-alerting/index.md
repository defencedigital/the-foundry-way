# How to monitor your service

In the Foundry, we follow the Service Manual guidance on [how to monitor the status of services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/monitoring-the-status-of-your-service).

We also follow Service Manual guidance on [how to set performance metrics](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/how-to-set-performance-metrics-for-your-service), although more content on measuring success is (or will be) in the [Product and service delivery](../../product-and-service-delivery/index.md) section of the Foundry Way.
