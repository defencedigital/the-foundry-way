# How to monitor your service

In the Foundry, we follow the Service Manual guidance on [how to monitor the status of services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/monitoring-the-status-of-your-service).

We also follow Service Manual guidance on [how to set performance metrics](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/how-to-set-performance-metrics-for-your-service), although more content on measuring success is (or will be) in the [Product and service delivery](../../product-and-service-delivery/index.md) section of the Foundry Way.

Product development teams should consider all log data sources available to them, following [NCSC guidance on protective monitoring](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/device-security-guidance/managing-deployed-devices/logging-and-protective-monitoring). Any sources which may help identify security incidents should be forwarded to the Digital Foundry security operations centre (SOC).
