# How we run services (a.k.a. Service Management)

In the Digital Foundry, we run our services in a consistent (but not necessarily uniform), proportionate and user-centred way. 

At a high- and principled-level, this broadly aligns to the principles articulated in ITIL v4; while we don't follow any one methodology prescribed by ITIL frameworks that exist in the world, this set of principles allows us to develop and run services in an agile- and DevOps-friendly manner. While we have no affiliation to them, [BMC wrote a blog post](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/itil-guiding-principles/) that shows how these principles align to the principles in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), and touches briefly on how they work with a DevOps mindset.

We will also increasingly align with the [Reliability Engineering](./reliability-engineering/index.md) model, [developed by Google](https://sre.google/) (but taken from many global organisations' practices).

This section of the Foundry Way puts these principles into more actionable guidance for our teams. It also aims to describe how/where we integrate with other service management processes across Defence.
