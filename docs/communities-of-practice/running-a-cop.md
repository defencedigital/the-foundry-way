# Running a community of practice

## Understanding your community’s user needs

The [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) emphasises the need to understand user needs, which ensures that you identify what your users need, not what you think they want. The same approach can be used to investigate the needs for setting up a community.

The Foundry uses these guidelines when setting up a new community. When thinking about researching a community's users' needs, ask yourself:

- who is in your community?
- who would you like to be in your community?
- what are their objectives?
- how do you help them to meet those goals?
- what is the main aim of the overall community? (mission or vision statement)
- what is the real use of the community? (actual usage or practice)
(if it’s a planned or newly created community) what services or tools do members currently use?
- how does community activity fit into members’ regular activity?

If you don’t have answers to any of these, [do user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/index.html) with your community members.

## Where to start

Always start with the people. Focus on getting community membership right and understand who they are and what their needs are. Work out who:

- will help the community to function effectively
- is already in the community
- should be invited to attend

Once you have the people, then develop a programme of activities with them. Understand or establish what the community should be doing (or wants to do), then work out how you can help users achieve that aim. Think about activities, events, communications and other ways to reinforce and build on the community’s engagement. Work out how to create good community habits as well as special events.

Only then should you establish which platforms will help the community to thrive. Work out how to introduce these without too much pain. Keep refining them, but don't obsess about them.
