Who can do what First things first, anybody can either suggest changes or raise issues relating to the Foundry Way. However, this does not necessarily mean that those changes will be accepted or those issues acted upon. The overarching principle is that content relating to a thematic area (e.g. software development) is governed by the relevant community of practice. As such, changes to and acceptance of content will be coordinated by the head of that community of practice (e.g. the Principal Developer). See our communities pages for more info. Hopefully it won't come to this, but in the case where a consensus can't be reached, the head of discipline will case the deciding vote (or veto). How to contribute (the practicalities) There are a few ways that you can contribute, based on either your technical propensities, thematic knowledge, etc. If you're happy with using git (and GitHub), feel free either to raise a pull request (PR) or an issue.

The Data Strategy defines a framework approach to describing the ways and means available to achieve the desired transformation. The Digital Foundry has been established to work within the Enabler and Facilitator spaces to consume the data rules, and help deliver the technology solutions that will meet the strategic vision. Enablers Facilitators What are the key outcomes? Discover-ability Accessibility Exploitability Foundry solutions will focus on increasing the ability to discover and understand what data is already held. It will put in place srvices which allow data to be published by data publishers as managed products, whilst increasing the control and governance of those uses.

The Defence Digital CDO function has identified 3 core pillars, and appointed leads in each of these areas: 1. Governance and Management 2. Data Architecture 3. Data Exploitation Foundry is intended to be the delivery engine which implements solutions to support and enable those pillars. Governance and Management Authorisation Foundry Teams will need to work with Data owners to ensure they have the right permissions in place to use and exploit Data. The CDO team will support teams in establishing Ownership and Stewardship process, Data Owner Identification Catalogues Data Cataloguing is a key mechanism to enable discoverability for users as well as provide management and governance tooling to data owners, and data stewards. Data Catalogues make use of metadata to describe content both to users, and to systems - so both user facing enterprise data catalogues and technical data-catalogues must be recognised, and in fact are often the same thing. Catalogues are used across the MoD at varying levels of maturity. There are also areas that do not make use of Catalogues or even metadata. Foundry will deliver the technical components needed to join up these various different levels of capability and enable a pan-defence view of data to be brought together into a federated central data catalogue. The catalogue will initially address the discoverability issues - ie exposing what data is in the estate. Once exposed, making that data accessible will need to follow via manual processes, maturing into system enabled processes.

They are how you track progress, create alignment, and encourage engagement around measurable goals. They are also very hard to do well! As with the rest of the Foundry Way, this section isn't about teaching you in-depth about OKRs; if you're interested in knowing more, have a look at the OKR bible - a.k.a. Radical Focus, by Christina Wodtke . Instead, this is intended to describe and link out to how we use OKRs (e.g. for reporting), as well as giving some lightweight guidance for generating and managing them. OKRs as a reporting mechanism More on reporting can be found in the ways of working section of the Foundry Way. Broadly speaking, your team's confidence in their ability to meet the KRs (and therefore, by definition, the Objectives) will be used by Foundry management to do a couple of things: Identify areas where teams may need additional support to increase the likelihood of KRs being achieved Lightweight reporting 'upwards', which shows what we're hoping to achieve in a given timescale. In essence, the Objectives replace what traditional reporting would have considered to be 'milestones' How to generate OKRs Generally speaking, OKRs are the business of a product manager (hence this guidance sitting in this section of the Foundry Way), but in reality it's a team sport. Step 1: initial setting of OKRs This step can be done with your team, or at a higher level (often with the Service Owner). Since the actual KRs should be based on your team\u2019s confidence (see the tracking OKRs section), you (or anybody higher in the programme/organisation, including the Service Owner) should not set these without them. How you do this is ultimately up to you, but the following template is designed to help you to sense-check what you're considering. It essentially forces you to consider the value, viability and measurability of the thing. Step 2: finalising OKRs This must be done with your team. You should not commit to OKRs before now. Once OKRs (objectives, in particular) have been set, you should work with your team to finalise them. This includes checking any assumptions you made previously, and setting final metrics. Your team\u2019s confidence in their ability to achieve an objective should be about 7-8 out of 10 to start with. This ensures that it\u2019s ambitious but achievable. You should then end up with something like\u2026 Objective: Create an Awesome Customer Experience Key results: Improve Net Promoter Score from 8 to 9 Increase repurchase rate by 13% Increase organic (non-paid-for) traffic by 20% Or a Foundry-specific example might be something like this: Objective: Tech for Digital Teams (T4DT) users can work and collaborate easily Key results: Developers can get access to basic tooling within 1 working day Users can get a Foundry email account within 1 working day 100% of Foundry staff have moved to assured virtual whiteboard software by the end of the quarter Tracking OKRs OKRs are only useful if they\u2019re part of your daily ways of working. This template (taken from Radical Focus) helps you do so, and to track other important team things. Note: only the top-right corner of the grid is OKR-specific; the remainder of the grid is for tracking other useful elements. Specifically, the top-left is for tracking weekly priorities, the bottom-left is for tracking notable things that are happening in the team's orbit that will affect your work, and the bottom-right is for tracking your team's health (mandatory in the Foundry) and any other metrics that you know you need to keep an eye on, probably including service level objectives (SLOs) . It's recommended that you do this as regularly as practical, but the expectation in the Foundry is that you'll do so at least monthly. Advice and 'gotchas' The following are things to watch out for when setting OKRs (especially the KR bit): Key results that have a boolean measurement (i.e. are either true or false) should be severely in the minority \u2013 numbers, percentages, etc. are better OKRs present a goal for a team to attain; how they do it is their business. As such, make sure you don\u2019t force a particular solution in their articulation Beware of KRs that are dependent on other people, teams, or work that\u2019s completely outside of your control. e.g. \u201cthis team has adopted our thing\u201d or \"this team has done [this thing]\"","title":"OKRs"},{"location":"people-skills-and-standards/product-management/artefacts/OKRs/#objectives-and-key-results-okrs","text":"Objectives and key results - or OKRs (note the lack of an apostrophe, you grammar heathens) - are part of a collaborative, goal-setting methodology used by teams and individuals to set challenging, ambitious goals with measurable results.

A common theme below is that names should be user-centred; however, this doesn\u2019t mean that you ask your users and go with their best ideas (that would usually be an anti-pattern). Instead, what it means is that user-centred design specialists in your team should be heavily involved in the generation of a name or names, followed by the name being \u2018signed off\u2019 by the Product Manager/Owner and/or Service Owner of the product or service. For clarity, here\u2019s a list of people who should not name things. You may wish to run options past these people/groups if you have a few options that are testing equally well, but otherwise your naming should be based on users and their needs. So, names should not be set by: Higher-level bodies, such as programmes (even if they\u2019re funding the product or service) Senior stakeholders or other people with general authority Naming teams and projects Since team and project names are internal, it ultimately doesn\u2019t matter what you call them. You\u2019ll often name the project or team before you know what the end product/service is going to do, so it stands to reason that the team or project name might not reflect what the solution is named. However, it is worth considering the following: If you want people to engage with your project/team, it might be worth using a name that describes what the problem space the team/project is working in Since it is highly unlikely that the end product will be named the same as your project or team, it\u2019s worth managing the expectations of stakeholders (especially senior ones) early on, so that you don\u2019t feel too committed to the name when it comes to naming your product/service Naming a product, service, platform, etc. Transactional products/services According to the GOV.UK Service Manual, good names for a service: use the words users use are based on analytics and user research describe a task, not a technology do not need to change when policy or technology changes are verbs, not nouns do not include government department or agency names are not brand-driven or focused on marketing If your product or service is public-facing, it must follow those GOV.UK Service Manual guidelines. Nobody has the prerogative to deviate from this. However, not all products/services are transactional and, even when they are, they often require or allow users to do more than one main activity, which makes naming more difficult. Therefore, you should consider the following principles. Complex transactional services For products and services that have too many or too diverse a set of transactions to allow for a sensible verb-based name, then the above guidance may not make sense. In this case, you will certainly have to research several names with users, but you may wish to consider the following: Is there a higher-level verb that broadly describes the thing? Can you use the final transaction in a series of things to describe the whole? For example, \u2018Apply for a [something]\u2019 might also include \u2018Check if you\u2019re eligible for a [something]\u2019 and \u2018Get help with a [something]\u2019 Is there a well-known (within your user community) product that does a similar thing, whose name you can (legally and ethically) borrow or adapt? Non-transactional products, services, platforms, etc. This type of \u2018thing\u2019 should continue to follow the GOV.UK Service Manual guidelines as closely as possible, but without contriving a name that sounds too odd or difficult to engage with. Again, this will almost certainly require considerable research with your users.

For example, there might be a minimum \u2018up time\u2019 \u2013 say, 99.95% \u2013 which would thereby allow a maximum amount of downtime over a period of time (a month, a year, etc.). Similarly, there might be a minimum performance level, such as being able to handle at least 1000 concurrent requests per second at all times. The problem with SLAs like this is that they can be one-dimensional: they are rarely based on the actual outcomes that they mean to achieve, and they are often illogically applied. This, in turn, often leads to over-optimisation and therefore increases in costs. For example, for services that are generally only used in business hours in one timezone, ensuring high availability and performance overnight is very expensive indeed. And should the service go down (for example for maintenance) in a period of time in which no users are impacted, does it make sense to penalise for dropping below a threshold when the result is a more reliable service in the longer term (i.e. by doing maintenance when needed)? SLAs are still a thing in (S)RE, particularly since those employing it usually do have contractual obligations (which we don\u2019t, since our \u2018customers\u2019 are within the same organisation), but the approach outlined below (SLIs and SLOs) comes first. Re-introducing service levels Metrics that matter: SLIs Let\u2019s take an example from above: \u2018uptime\u2019. \u2018Uptime\u2019 is a blunt instrument and doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a service level that the user is experiencing. It\u2019s also not specific about what we mean by uptime. Does it mean how many hours a day the servers are running? Or how many errors the server returns to a user? Or something else? Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are about understanding what the intended effect is and then to describe how we can measure that intent. The above, then, may change to become something like this: The availability of the service to users, as indicated by percentage of user requests that receive a HTTP status code in the 4xx or 5xx ranges. Here you can see a clear outcome or effect (service level) you are trying to indicate (availability), followed by a technical description of how that will be measured. Reliable enough: SLOs So in the above example, what is \u2018reliable enough\u2019? In answering that question, we can decide what our objective should be for that service level. Objectives should be based on users (including non-human users like systems that use APIs and suchlike) needs and expectations. Since breaching the objective requires teams to divert efforts to resolving the situation, it\u2019s also important not to over-egg the objectives beyond what\u2019s genuinely needed. So, if a system isn\u2019t \u2018critical\u2019 (e.g. life-saving or -threatening) and having a less performant service is acceptable (e.g. you could wait 5 seconds for a page to load), then ensure that the objective is representative. Similarly, if users are willing to reload a page if they get an error, then don\u2019t have penalising objectives based on availability. Coupled with the SLI, the SLO needn\u2019t be complicated. In this case, it may be: The SLO is for 99% availability of the service for users. Measuring and reporting Since we have established a categorically, technically measurable metric in this process, it means that we can necessarily implement monitoring. This thereby automates the process of collecting metrics, rather than somebody having to do manual reporting on a regular basis. So that\u2019s measuring and monitoring, but what about reporting? Reporting is primarily for the benefit of and action by the team supporting the service, since any dip below the SLO should result in action being taken to rectify the situation. In reality, this will also be discussed with the Service Owner, in many cases, if it will significantly impact the prioritisation of other work. This is because rectification of a breach of SLOs should take priority over almost all other work (excepting things like urgent security work). Other than automatically-measured metrics, no other metrics relating to reliability will be provided to any stakeholders, since they are implicitly irrelevant to the service and its users. What this means for our stakeholders Our users For our users, this is only good news. It means that we focus on ensuring that they get a service that\u2019s reliable enough for their needs, while putting appropriate time and focus into the work that makes a real (positive) difference to them. Our customers For our customers, such as the parts of the business on whose behalf we are delivering a product or service, there are different considerations. In particular, they need to ensure that their programme funding is being well spent! Since we\u2019re all working for the same organisation, we have to have a collaborative relationship rather than a contractual or penal one. As such, the Foundry will: Ensure that the relevant parties are involved in establishing SLOs (often the Service Owner) Vow that, if the service dips below the SLO threshold, work will immediately be prioritised to bring it back above that line Provide sight of performance metrics against these SLOs, as they become available (i.e. once the work has been done to put the technical monitoring in place, once SLOs are established)","title":"Service levels"},{"location":"running-services/reliability-engineering/service-levels/#service-levels","text":"","title":"Service Levels"},{"location":"running-services/reliability-engineering/service-levels/#the-traditional-context","text":"In traditional IT, and in particular in matters of commercial agreements (i.e. contracts), the norm was to state \u2018service level agreements\u2019 (SLAs) as a way of guaranteeing (lest the provider have penalties foist upon them) certain minimum levels of performance against the given theme.

By doing this, you can avoid potential security vulnerabilities. Any automated tools you use to manage third party dependencies should be compatible with MOD recommended programming languages . The tools you use should neither slow down your development process nor disclose potential security vulnerabilities to the public. You can read more about managing software dependencies in the Service Manual , where you will find a list of common dependency management tools. Our programming language style guides also contain language-specific advice about managing dependencies (for example, managing Python dependencies). Update dependencies frequently Update your dependencies frequently rather than in \u2018big bang\u2019 batches. This works well with continuous delivery principles and makes sure the changes introduced are small and can be automatically tested. There are tools which scan GitHub repositories and raise pull requests when they find dependency updates. Teams at MOD are using: Dependabot - available on GitHub SaaS and recommended as part of the Defence Digital template-repository Note: this is separate from the security-only updates provided automatically by GitHub Dependabot. Note: repos requiring at least one approving review for PRs cannot, and should not, use Dependabot\u2019s auto-approve-and-merge facility. Note: we have not enabled \u201cTreat PR approval as a request to merge\u201d, as this would lead to a surprising behaviour at the point of approval. - PyUP - a Python dependency checker. Monitor for vulnerabilities You should monitor for potential vulnerabilities in every layer of your technology stack. This is not straightforward but tooling exists to help. The Service Manual provides guidance on browser technology, tooling and mailing lists you can subscribe to . Most of the tooling that helps you stay on top of dependency updates will also highlight vulnerabilities. Additional tooling includes: GitHub security alerts When GitHub discovers or is informed about a vulnerability, it will email an alert to the repository owner and users with admin access. GitHub security alerts will be turned on for all github.com/defencedigital repositories. If services wish to opt out of security advisories on their repository, they can contact Digital Foundry Security and then add the no-security-advisories tag to their repository. Snyk Snyk is capable of detecting vulnerabilities in a variety of languages including all the GDS supported programming languages. You can configure Snyk to raise PRs, email regular reports and alert you when new vulnerabilities are detected. To be added to the Snyk orgnisation, please reach out on Defence Digital Slack #security. Archive old repositories If you have an old repository that is receiving security alerts but is not being worked on or maintained, you may wish to archive your repository instead. Security Dashboards TODO The Foundry Security team will investigate providing a security dashboard that gives service teams visibility of vulnerabilities in their repositories. This may require the repositories for your service to be tagged correctly. Managing Container dependencies Rebuild Container base images Like dependencies, Container base images are also frequently updated. If you run containers as part of your service, you should regularly rebuild your images (and base images) to include the latest updates. Automate this process where possible. Specifying Container image tags The Foundry Way Containerfile guidance contains advice on how to use image tags to specify the exact container image version to use. Use official Container base images Always use official base images. The main container registries (including Quay as used by the Defence DevSecOps Service) regularly scans official images and you can view the results by logging into the container registry. If you do not regularly update your base image, you must make sure a manual process exists to monitor and prioritise fixes for detected vulnerabilities.

By doing this, you can avoid potential security vulnerabilities. Any automated tools you use to manage third party dependencies should be compatible with MOD recommended programming languages . The tools you use should neither slow down your development process nor disclose potential security vulnerabilities to the public. You can read more about managing software dependencies in the Service Manual , where you will find a list of common dependency management tools.
